### The Context

### The Coordinate System

The coordinate system of the `2d` context is a Cartesian system with its origin
at the top left of the canvas element, a unit of 1 pixel, its $x$ axis goes to
the right, and its $y$ axis goes to the bottom.

The origin is the point on the top left of the top-left pixel, coordinate $(1,
1)$ is the bottom right of that pixel. The center of the pixel is $(0.5, 0.5)$.
