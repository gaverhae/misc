# Chapter 2 - Graphics in the Browser: the Canvas Element

## The Anatomy of the Game

## Drawing Inside the Browser

There are three ways to draw in a browser:

- manipulating DOM elements,
- manipulating SVG,
- drawing on a canvas.

This book focuses on canvas: DOM elements are fine for very simple games, but
coordinating animations is difficult; and generating SVG is hard because XML.

> I think a lot of the reasons given against SVG and DOM in this book are much
> weaker now in a post-React world, but ultimately they still hold enough to
> make a strong case for canvas.
