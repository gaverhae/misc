# Introduction

This book is about developing games with JavaScript, HTML5, and Node.js. It
will use Canvas as its main display and will cover how to add sound,
networking, and basic AI. It will **not** cover JavaScript itself, nor any
notion of game design â€” only game programming, assuming readers know JavaScript
and HTML5.
