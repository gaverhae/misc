# Chapter 4 - Animation and Sprites

Lines and rectangles only get you so far. At some point, you'll want real
images in your game, and they will likely come in the form of PNG files that
include several "sprites", like this:

## Sprites

A raster image is called a _sprite_, and when multiple sprites are in the same
image, as in the example above, we call that image a _sprite sheet_.

Raster images are somewhat simpler than vector graphics, but they don't scale
very well in either appearance or performance.
