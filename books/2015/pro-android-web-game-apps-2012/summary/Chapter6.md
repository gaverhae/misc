# Chapter 6 - Rendering Virtual Worlds

Sometimes, the game world is bigger than what is shown on the screen.

## Tile Maps

Often, a big world will be composed of repeating patterns.

### The Idea Behind Tile Maps

Tiles are small images designed to fit each other without breaking the pattern:
if we draw two compatible tiles side-by-side, it is not obvious where one ends
and the next one begins.

If our world is composed of tiles, instead of storing one huge image for the
world, we can store the world as a tile map: a rectangular image that contains
a single instance of each tile, and a table of integers, where each integer is
the index of a tile in the image file.

### Implementing a Tile Map

We use square tiles as they are a bit simpler; other shapes are possible, and
the principles are exactly the same.

The images for this chapter, a tileset and a few objects, can be found [here][0].

Let's write those tiles on the screen. We'll assume we have the world
description, as a 2-dimensional array, in [a separate `world.js` file][1]
defining the `world` variable. We then design a `MapRenderer` class:

[1]: https://github.com/Apress/pro-android-web-game-apps/blob/9e08321ca08e49246f51b1c88bc1ce1ab982aad8/code/v.01/js/world.js

```javascript
function MapRenderer(mapData, image, tileSize) {
  this._mapData = mapData;
  this._image = image;
  this._tileSize = tileSize;
  this._x = this._y = 0;
  this._tilesPerRow = image.width / tileSize;
}
_p = MapRenderer.prototype;
```

We assume square tiles here, hence a single parameter for their size, and the
rather easy computation of tiles per row. The `_x` and `_y` properties are
meant to represent the point at which we draw the map; i.e. if the user
"scrolls" the map we'll update them.

```javascript
_p.draw = function(ctx) {
  for (var cellY = 0; cellY < this._mapData.length; cellY++) {
    for (var cellX = 0; cellX < this._mapData[cellY].length; cellX++) {
      var tileId = this._mapData[cellY][cellX];
      this._drawTileAt(ctx, tileId, cellX, cellY);
    }
  }
};
_p._drawTileAt = function(ctx, tileId, cellX, cellY) {
  var srcX = (tileId % this._tilesPerRow) * this._tileSize;
  var srcY = Math.floor(tileId / this._tilesPerRow) * this._tileSize;
  var size = this._tileSize;
  var destX = this._x + cellX * size;
  var destY = this._y + cellY * size;
  ctx.drawImage(this._image, srcX, srcY, size, size, destX, destY, size, size);
};
_p.move = function(deltaX, deltaY) {
  this._x += deltaX;
  this._y += deltaY;
};
```

See [book code][2] for a full usage example.

There are two main issues with that code:

- We redraw the entire map on every frame, regardless of whether we can see all
  of it.
- We redraw the enitre map on every frame, regardless of whether it has
  changed.

We will see various ways to address both of these issues over the next few
sections, but first, let's put in place some measurement so we can see the
impact of our efforts.

### Measuring FPS

We use [xStats][3].

## Optimizing Rendering Performance

### Draw Only What Is Required

If we know the viewport size (say, `width` and `height`), the current position
(`x` and `y`), and the tile size (`size`), we can determine the "tile set
rectangle" with:

```javascript
var left = Math.max(0, Math.floor(-x/size));
var right = Math.min(world[0].length -1, Math.floor((width - x) / size));
var top = Math.max(0, Math.floor(-y/size));
var bottom = Math.min(world.length - 1, Math.floor((height - y) / size));
```

and reduce the range of both indices in the `MapRenderer.draw` method.

> This gets the author from 27 to 34 images per second, which is still not 60.

### Offscreen Buffer

Drawing a single big image is faster than drawing lots of small ones that cover
the same area. To take advantage of that, we create a second canvas, generally
called the "offscreen buffer", and draw on that first, then copy it to the
visible canvas.

In this model, we are still clearing and redrawing the entire visible canvas in
each call from `requestAnimationFrame`, but we redraw it by copying the
offscreen buffer to it.

How does this help? The offscreen buffer is _not_ redrawn on every frame, but
only when it needs to change. We still redraw the offscreen canvas as part of
the `requestAnimationFrame` callback, using pretty much the exact code we had
before.

There is a little bit of added bookkeeping: the offscreen canvas needs to have
the same size as the main one, and we need a flag to know when it's dirty.

> This gets the author to 45fps.

There's a catch, though: while we do less work _overall_, we do _more_ work
when the offscreen buffer is dirty, which is when things happen and thus when
the user might notice it most.

> This isn't as bad as one might think at first, though, because even if the
> user is scrolling, they are likely not scrolling by 60 pixels a second.

### Catching the Area Around the Viewport

One way we can improve this is by making the offscreen buffer slightly larger.
So far, we draw the offscreen buffer with

```javascript
mainCtx.drawImage(offCanvas, 0, 0);
```

but it would be about as fast if we did:

```javascript
mainCtx.drawImage(offCanvas, x, y, mainWidth, mainHeight, dx, dy, mainWidth, mainHeight);
```

If we align the offscreen size on tiles, we can limit redrawing the offscreen
canvas to the times our "tile box" changes. See [book code][5] for the full
result.

> This now allows the author to hold on to 45fps when the map is moving.

Note that the same idea of discretizing updates can be applied to loading the
`world` description from the server: if we define it as a "big enough" square
around the user position, we can periodically update it when the user nears a
border.

> Expanding that further, tilesets could be loaded (and unloaded) based on that
> "loaded world" square.

## World Objects

Game objects are sprites.

### Coordinate Systems

Whereas the map has a position within the screen, objects have a position
within the map. We typically consider three coordinate systems: the screen
coordinates (e.g. click events, rendering), the world coordinates, and the tile
coordinates.

In a top-down, square-tile view like we have so far, transformations between
those are mathematically easy, but it is important, at the code level, to
always know in which system we are.

### Implementing WorldObjectRenderer

The goal of WorldObjectRenderer is to render objects on the screen. Objects
will typically know their sprite sheet, frame in the sheet, and position _in
the game world_; the job of WorldObjectRenderer is thus to manage the
translation between world coordinates and screen coordinates.

### Rendering Order

If objects can overlap, they need to be drawn in the correct order. In our
simple case of top-down, square tiles, this basically means sorting them by `y`
coordinate. In a complex game with a lot of objects, sorting on every frame may
be too slow.

### Optimizations

When drawing tiles, we can easily compute a bouding box for the screen. Objects
can have any position, and possibly move. We don't want to draw the ones that
are outside the screen if we can avoid it.

We basically have two options:

1. Look at all the objects, for each render. This is viable for [some
   games][6], but not most of them.
2. Try to do something smart. Because of its wide range of applications, this
   problem has been heavily researched (e.g. [R-Tree][7]).

[6]: https://tiny-island-survival.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Island
[7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree

A simple option is to expand again on our offscreen buffer idea: we divide the
world in a big grid, and organize objects by cells in that grid. It is then
easy to check which cells of the grid intersect with the viewport, and loop
only on those objects. In this model, it is possible for an object to be in
multiple cells, because a cell would "contain" all the objects that intersect
with it.

> Note that we are optimizing _the render loop_ here. This way of organizing
> the game objects may not necessarily make the "state update loop" faster.

## Isometric View

An isometric projection is one in which the angles between the three (3d) axes
(as seen by projecting them on the 2d screen) are at 120Â° with each other.

A conceptual square on the ground thus looks like a lozenge that is twice as
wide as it is tall. A rectangle on the screen will be covered by half-lozenges
on the edges. Our code for mapping world coordinates to screen coordinates
needs to be adjusted. That said, the principles remain true, and not that much
of the code needs to change.

There are two main approaches to defining coordinates in isometric views:
either we keep the axes parallel to the edges of the screen, and live with the
fact that every other row is shifted half a diamond width, or we use the
"pre-rotation" axes, which follow the lozenges, with typically $x$ pointing to
the bottom right and $y$ to the bottom left (and $z$ upwards).
