 # Pro Android Web Game Apps (2012)

I started reading this book back in 2015, then somehow go distracted along the
way. As I'm writing this in 2024, I am picking it back up because I am feeling
stuck in a web-based game project I'm working on, and this is the web-based
game book I have at hand.

I am also on a quest to wrap up a number of unfinished things I started long
ago, so this fits with that too.

The book focuses on library-free JavaScript, which is obviously not what I'm
using, so there will be some extra work needed to bring the content of the book
into "my" world; hopefully this extra work will actually make the learning
experience better overall.
