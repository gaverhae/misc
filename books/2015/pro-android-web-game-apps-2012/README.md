 # Pro Android Web Game Apps (2012)

I started reading this book back in 2015, then somehow go distracted along the
way. As I'm writing this in 2024, I am picking it back up because I am feeling
stuck in a web-based game project I'm working on, and this is the web-based
game book I have at hand.

I am also on a quest to wrap up a number of unfinished things I started long
ago, so this fits with that too.

The book focuses on library-free JavaScript, which is obviously not what I'm
using, so there will be some extra work needed to bring the content of the book
into "my" world; hopefully this extra work will actually make the learning
experience better overall.

I have written up a summary of the book, and collected here all of the code
I've written as part of reading it. Some of it is me just retyping code sample
from the book, and some is original.

Links to examples in the summary assume you have started the local web server
with `server start` in a [direnv]-allowed [Nix] shell in this folder.
