# file sort

A small utility to help me organize and clean-up my hard drives.

Started out as a Bash line in my shell history:

```bash
find /Volumes/to_sort /Volumes/TOSHIBA ~/Downloads ~/Desktop  -type f | wc -l
```

But now I'd like to evolve this a bit to get more details, such as a breakdown
per folder or a list of new files since I last checked.
